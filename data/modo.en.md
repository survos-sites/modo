# Rules of the Game

If there were a simple way to define time, we might say it is a volatile concept,
understood from the perspective of where one stands. Time holds different
meanings and flows differently for each of us. Thus, we know that time is
relative.

For those of us who inhabit a “normal” space, we align time with our daily
activities and schedules—work, study, or leisure. But what happens to those
whose lives are confined to a space where time is not only managed but
seemingly frozen?

For someone deprived of their freedom, time becomes a quantifiable
substance, as it defines both the future and the length of their stay in some
place. Behind the walls, days transform into journeys that must be planned
through endless repetitive practices, using survival strategies to combat
boredom.

Play and art are vital in penitentiary spaces because they temporarily replace
the order and uniformity of daily life. Play creates a parallel space to that of
the prison—a different dimension—and becomes a tactic for escaping the
monotony and weight of the prison routine. Art moves in the same direction
but transcends it, as it not only requires an investment of time but also
produces knowledge about the penitentiary context and, more importantly,
about the individual who assumes the role of artist.

Play and artistic creation are bound by agreements that emerge between
individuals and groups and cannot be imposed. Thus, the playful and artistic
acts are anchored in a shared need for emancipation and autonomy—an
essential rule that deserves attention.

# Transmission Room

There have always been personal messages transmitted in code, aiming to
explain the world and reality. This is perhaps the first step, the fundamental
phase pursued by all playful and artistic activities. Communicating messages
without the need to mention them literally amplifies ideas and makes them
more efficient. In this case, we may realize that, indeed, the medium is the
message.

A simple figurative game of brain transplants served as an excuse with
the inmates of Cevarepsi and Tepepan to imagine what would happen if
we could swap our minds with anyone else. The conclusions were clear
when conceiving the head as the control center for ideas, as it is in the head
where reason, moderation, and consequently, the place where analysis and
judgment are made.

Ironically, the unique structure and tissue of the brain evoked the paths
taken through a labyrinth, as thought can be subjected to confusing routes
that, invariably, seek an exit. These exits are part of a game of forms or
expressions developed within two penitentiary centers designed to serve
individuals considered to be psychiatric.

In this way, transmission machines, compasses, Ouija boards, hidden
codes, maps, and labyrinths incorporate metaphors conceived in remote and
forbidden places, unseen by the common gaze. These create instant images
that, while functioning as measuring instruments, also serve as vehicles and
bridges capable of taking us to other realms of understanding and sanity.
They point us in the right direction to imagine the world in the same way those
labeled justice and the medicine of thought do, enabling us to understand
them.


# Enhanced Perception

The collective photographic exercise Enhanced Perception is the result of
an ambitious project in which, through the interpretation of instant camera
photos, participants in the art workshop at Tepepan and CEVAREPSI poured
their ideas onto photographic images using a nearly forgotten and now
obsolete technique: instant photography.

For many, simply holding a camera for the first time was a significant moment,
both in planning the image to be photographed as well as the magic of
obtaining an image instantly. What emerges from this exercise is inscribed in
the realm of artistic formation, through the use of the camera, a device that
is only partially accessible in a prison environment.

The interpretation of an image hinges on one’s perception of their surroundings
and how so-called immediate reality is filtered through the camera’s
mechanical eye before being captured on a surface. These images become
a playful catalyst, offering us a glimpse into the minds of their creators and a
deeper understanding of their perspectives.

The cameras and film rolls accompanying this project act as carriers of
memories, serving as windows into a past where photography was not just
a tool for capturing reality but also a means of experiencing heightened
perception and engaging with space in a parallel way.


# Electroencephalogram of Social Bureaucracy in Contemporary Mexico. 1962-

The narrative used by MAFO, a pseudonym adopted years ago by an inmate
at CEVAREPSI, represents a series of personal and social phenomena. This
exhibition presents a fraction of the author’s vast reflective archive: texts,
drawings, autobiographies, and cartographic exercises carefully selected by
MAFO to create a general electroencephalogram of his surroundings.

Despite physical hardships—though not reflective ones—MAFO’s work is
crafted with care and precision. His discipline and commitment are admirable,
and his art practice serves as a mechanism for managing time in prison. He
organizes himself to spend long hours reading in the library and reflecting
on the texts available to him. His readings, writings, and detailed drawings
reflect his concerns.

The abundance and richness of data contained in his drawings contrast with
the restrictions and scarcity that exist in prison. This disparity is represented
through a dialogue with the excessive accumulation of office supplies and
bureaucratic materials, which, despite their massive presence, become
useless—just like many of the processes within a penitentiary institution.

If MAFO’s works were not exhibited, they would remain condemned to
darkness and oblivion. This is, therefore, an exceptional opportunity to get to
know a complex individual, to understand his life and work, and to witness a
long examination of society, as seen by MAFO, from the 1960s to today.


# Overcoming Weightlessness

The Space Race of the 1960s was a remarkable era of tension and rivalry
between two superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—where
space exploration served not only as a technical and scientific challenge
but also as a battleground for political and cultural propaganda. As the
competition intensified, both nations created a vast array of artifacts that
embodied the excitement and ambition of this pivotal chapter in human
curiosity and discovery.

On the Soviet side, government propaganda was portrayed in a series of
objects celebrating the country’s space achievements, technological suc-
cesses, and ideological supremacy. For instance, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin’s
medals were awarded at official events, becoming emblems of national pride
and the USSR’s scientific and military discipline.

Life magazine played a crucial role in documenting the Space Race, covering
both the achievements of American astronauts and the early steps of the
Soviets in space. The stunning images of astronauts and their feats captured
the public’s imagination, helping to cement the collective fascination with
space and science.

This same fascination with the vast unknown has undoubtedly been a source
of inspiration for inmates at both Tepepan and CEVAREPSI. Spaceships and
cosmic phenomena have been depicted in the artwork of some workshop
participants, while discussions about science fiction films or UFO sightings
are common in the classroom. It is reasonable to assume that confinement
leads us to imagine what lies beyond, what remains free from our constraints.


# Extraplanetary Beings

The drawing of hands is particularly difficult due to their anatomical structure
and the expressiveness they convey. Zefe uses light and shadow as tools to
create a series of sketches of imaginary beings formed by the gestures of
his own hands. The hand positions suggest the practice of shadow play—a
game of hand shadows projected onto a wall, imitating the silhouettes
and movements of animals. These beings, creations of Zefe, are neither
ordinary animals nor necessarily belong to Earth. They are part of a personal
bestiary, possibly inspired by the author’s past experiences indicating the
existence—but not the origin—of three major types of beings: Mammaloids,
Plantoids, and Insectoids.

These pieces are accompanied by a series of luminous objects that re-
main dormant: unlit bulbs and tubes that may never have been turned on,
displayed as a catalogue of a past modernity once envisioned as a bright
future. The symbolic exchange between these dormant and deactivated ob-
jects and Zefe’s drawings reveals a shadowed or eclipsed counterpart, turn-
ing this space into a dark-room where one might play hide-and-seek.

Each drawing has been titled after one of his fellow inmates, as Zefe cares
for them in the penitentiary. Whenever he attends class, he often brings a
different companion, inviting them to participate. Each drawing thus becomes
a reminder of who was with him at that moment, while he worked.


# Playful Cartographies

Throughout the exhibition, there are many elements that provide clues to
understanding the intentions and needs of the participants. Explanations,
methods, narratives, and connections with numerous objects from the MODO
collection offer us enough insight to comprehend those who, for now, are not
physically present. Through their pieces, they guide us, as if handing us a
map equipped with compasses.

Maps—and cartography in particular—abstract and synthesize geographic,
and even celestial or astrological, spaces. In the same way, maps may also be
able to abstract complex areas of thought and behavior. This room presents
documentation from an ongoing project.

The central idea revolves around the game of STOP, a childhood game in
which players declare war on their worst enemy, symbolized by a country.
The women of Tepepan have spent weeks adapting STOP into a game
that involves flags, maps, and adversaries—replacing countries with more
immediate enemies, such as illegal drugs or certain pharmaceuticals. The
game transforms into a living action, a kind of playful performance.

This project demands space. Here, we can observe its progress and the
discussions that have emerged from a game that, ultimately, holds deep
symbolism and provides the necessary coordinates to understand the needs
of the women of Tepepan.

# Juan

Regardless of the simplicity of the elements in Juan’s work and their
arrangement, the messages are clear and forceful, as many are written and
carefully illustrated. Juan expresses a specific interest in his journey through
the penitentiary, comparing it to a series of labyrinths that evoke situations
and conditions experienced there.

Virtually every fragment of Juan’s collages and drawings present a series of
themes that must be addressed to understand both the artist and the context
in which he lives. Juan makes constant and accurate statements in his own
terms and by his own means.


# Ale

Ale’s work is complex and unsettling; it is rare for someone to spend so much
time and meticulousness in the creation of a piece as she does. The unique
textures characteristic of engraving indicate a journey across what seems to
be the surfaces of a territory known only to Ale. However, this may be the
beginning of a broader project.

When asked about the motives and nature of her work, Ale would merely say
it was an exercise and that it held no significance. Fortunately, the drawing
suggests otherwise: the richly organic lines and strokes depict paths through
a kind of labyrinth, possibly corporeal, while also conveying the necessity of
an exhaustive reading of each interstice.


# Norma

Despite the fact that after completion, some corrections were made to the
phrases connecting the thoughts, Norma’s work functions both technically
and thematically. The transmission of data and thoughts makes the central
figure perhaps a kind of self-portrait or reflection of the artist. The original
messages, rather than being erased or corrected, remain veiled behind
strokes of paint that heighten the enigma and the message.

On the other hand, Norma’s pictorial skills are evident in her ability to render
tones close to skin and organic matter. There is no doubt that not only her
skills but also her motivations and themes are of great importance in her
work.


# Carmen

Carmen’s work presents, in her words, two minds and two telepathic
transmitters intertwining to communicate ideas and possibly emotions.

At one point, a fellow student mentioned that the heart in the background of
her painting was too obvious and perhaps simplistic. Carmen justified it as
a common and necessary symbol to give meaning to her painting since, in
this case, the transmission of ideas occurs between a couple connected by
thought.


# Soto

Soto maintains a constant concern about things that observe us from
the outside, which is why his work narrates, through a cosmic map, his
testimonies and accounts of sightings from the courtyards of CEVAREPSI.
Spaceships, comets, and planetary surfaces create an exchange between
the penitentiary space and the cosmos—an essential exchange, since within
the classroom, Soto narrates each element of his paintings one by one.
Every planet and every orbit are fully identified and serve a purpose in this
vast spatial polyptych.

The connection with MODO’s photographic and journalistic archive is clear.
The selection of numerous testimonies from the space race of the 1960s can
be appreciated in open dialogue with the exhibited work. Contrary to what
one might think, Soto possesses extensive knowledge of astronomy, whose
validity can be verified both in the publications and the selected photographs.


# Uriel

The influence of graffiti is evident in Uriel’s work, and it persists despite
confinement. From small drawings, commissions, and various sketches, he
was encouraged to undertake a more personal and extensive project. At
times, it is impossible to have a personal space with all necessary tools, so
his work bears traces of its movement, folds, and constant handling. However,
these tears and marks are also part of the artwork and reflect Uriel’s process.

Similarly, graffiti on the street often presents these same characteristics
inherent to the speed in which they are executed. Uriel’s work is easily
readable and displays his concerns and interests coexisting within the same
picture.


# Augusto

For years, Augusto has demonstrated great commitment to his work,
achieving progress, changes, and explorations in formats and drawing
techniques. In some cases, his use of ballpoint pen—a popular drawing
instrument in penitentiaries worldwide—recalls engraving. His work
revolves around biographical and mythological themes simultaneously.
The fusion of Japanese traditions and the history of his ancestry interweave
in his art, also including characters who were significant during his time in
the penitentiary.

To illustrate Augusto’s experiences and concerns, his work is accompanied
by objects and images from MODO’s extensive collection closely related to
Eastern cultures. The collection presented here illustrates the evolution of
these practices and their cultural relevance over time.


# Rosaura

There are many ways to pass the time, not only for those deprived of liberty
or undergoing medical treatment but also for ordinary people who need to
manage their idle or tedious moments.

Rosaura, a resident of the Tepepan Women’s Center, has always enjoyed
solving word puzzles. Alongside her work in the art workshop, she often keeps
one or two clippings of these simple games. The topics chosen for these
mass-printed pastimes are usually basic and elementary. After observing
her fondness for them, the idea arose for Rosaura to create her own word
games using simple handmade ink stamps.

Some fellow inmates, especially Paty, collaborated with Rosaura in selecting
words and crafting her pieces. The printing accidents in some letters were
embraced by Rosaura as appealing and amusing gestures in the final
outcome, marking the beginning of a plastic experimentation.

Ultimately, the connection with MODO’s vast collection of typefaces makes
evident the great impact of the printing press on the dissemination of ideas
and knowledge. Similarly, on a personal level, Rosaura shares her ideas
through a pastime where the word puzzle provides clues to understanding
her.


# Torices

In contrast to the expressive tendencies of his peers, for Torices, precision
and meticulousness are fundamental to communicating his ideas. The image
of the bridge as a metaphor for communication and as a link for symbols
and messages is as clear and sensible as his strokes. Torices speaks of his
own spirituality and intelligently employs an architectural projection without
falling into religious iconography. It is rare to find a student that displays
such interest in the art workshop, along side his creative work and consistent
performance.

Torices’ piece is anchored to a series of postcards belonging to the MODO
collection. Most of them depict bridges connecting two spaces, much like
Torices’ work. Similarly, two extraordinary transparencies displayed against
the light reveal the silhouettes of a bridge shrouded in shadows, leaving the
mystery of its location unresolved.


# Martín

Martín was a student who stayed at Cevarepsi for a period long enough to
showcase his extraordinary pencil-drawing skills. Usually, any artist requires
a model, and it is rare to find someone capable of transferring the images
that exist in their mind directly onto paper. Martín was able to describe what
would appear on the paper even before he started drawing. His exceptional
precision in anatomical drawing and the expression of gestures made him a
prodigy in his discipline.

Moreover, after leaving the penitentiary, Martín continued working on the
streets of the city. Encounters with him were not uncommon, and they
confirmed that the act of drawing was a core part of his life—a necessity for
expressing ideas, both for himself and eventually, for others.


# El Arqui

A perfect pseudonym for a member of the Cevarepsi community who
studied architecture and might have been expected to create a work based
on organized planning. However, the watercolor he presents is loaded with
symbolism that connects with his condition and transition through prison,
revisiting an old communicative game: the Ouija board.

Both the elements and the message are so clear that little explanation is
needed. The modification of the game and the incorporation of emblematic
elements from his context are evident.

Naturally, a Ouija board could not be missing from MODO’s collection. This
basic piece, both because of its origin and antiquity, evokes the idea of
communication between two dimensions. On one hand, there is a board,
sometimes considered a toy, and on the other, a drawing created by an
inmate in a confined space. It speaks not only of generating a message but
also of managing time through drawing and creative practice.


# Lisandro

Lisandro’s work has always been surprising due to the degree of representation
in which he expresses his ideas. In a brief conversation about his childhood
memories, Lisandro mentioned how much he liked roller coasters. Without
knowing for certain whether he ever rode one, the amusement ride serves as
an excuse to evoke a memory and fully abstract it.

This representation of a colossal mechanical ride is a new exploration in
Lisandro’s work, considering that in a previous exhibition, his focus was on
the human body, inspired by a self-portrait. This departure from his usual
themes and the exploration of a new format give us an idea of the immense
effort it took for him to achieve this, especially given the physical particularities
of the artist.


# Fidel

This landscape represents what Fidel was able to achieve as his first piece,
over a few months of work in the art workshop. He is an example of how
integration and discipline can be fostered by a participant. Fidel always paid
attention in class and experimented with themes, forms, and techniques. His
work was even featured on the cover of a nationwide magazine.

Fidel’s story does not end when he leaves the penitentiary. It continues
beyond, as he attends exhibitions where his work is displayed and stays in
contact with the workshop and penitentiary staff, suggesting that, if possible,
he be allowed to return to continue taking art classes.


# Scooby y los Osos Fantasma

Scooby, a funny pseudonym for the author and former resident of the
Male Rehabilitation Center for Psychosocial Care (Cevarepsi), conceived a
haunting triptych of three bears who, in his words, “froze to death 200 years
ago.”

After producing a large series of preliminary sketches on notebook paper,
poster boards, and any material Scooby could find, he decided to transfer
the original concept of the ghost bears to a larger format, increasing the
eloquence of the images. The ghost bears can be understood as variations
of the same character, who present only slight changes that distinguish them.
Nonetheless, Scooby individualizes each participant in the triptych, making
each one a unique element whose expression makes us feel observed.

This triptych is accompanied by a series of MODO collection pieces that lead
us into the realm of freezing and play. On one side, there are instruments
for handling frozen objects, such as old tongs and ice bags, which, in their
form, possess a peculiar allure, sometimes appearing to be measuring tools.
The same idea is echoed in an encapsulated teddy bear, which undoubtedly
could have served as a source of inspiration for Scooby.


# Viridiana

Viridiana’s painting demonstrates how a workshop assistant can extend
her discourse into ambitious and impactful work. The representation of a
brain is surrounded by a multitude of elements, codes, and formal pretexts,
illustrating all the ideas that influence Viridiana’s thoughts and those of any
ordinary person.

This is Viridiana’s second participation in MODO, as a token of her dedication
and commitment to the art classes within the penitentiary, where she has
always been attentive, offering comments and evaluations about what she
calls the imbalances that exist between the inside and outside of prison.

Curiously, Viridiana’s work is perfectly balanced in the painting she shares,
showing an expressive system of thought based on diverse elements that
coexist harmoniously. Originally, the painting spoke of a mental connection
with a loved one. However, due to the dimensions of the piece, the theme
evolved to include broader topics, such as animals, objects, and plants.
There is no doubt that Viridiana is and will remain one of the most remarkable
figures to have resided in the Tepepan Women’s Center.


# Verti

This celestial polyptych by Verti is an example of how one can work with
care and thoughtfulness. Using the pretext of showcasing what lies above
our heads and beyond our thoughts, Verti composed four landscapes of the
firmament, featuring clouds and vast skies. At certain moments, the forms
become intricate abstract constructions that some-what deviate from their
natural references, making pencil drawings a means to experiment with the
possibilities of medium and form.

The polyptych maintains a constant dialogue, bringing the landscapes closer
to photographic captures of remote or dreamlike places. When encountering
a landscape artist and draftsman of this caliber, it is important to address the
needs and concerns reflected in their work.


# Imanol

For Imanol, time and its management within the facility where he
receives treatment has multiple shades. His fascination with Japanese
culture has led him in different directions—on one hand, he stays active
by teaching Japanese to his peers, and on the other, he spends large
amounts of time crafting model swords using building blocks similar to
LEGO.

The objects he presents establish a direct dialogue with the MODO collection,
specifically artifacts related to battles and weaponry. The contrast is striking:
the cold metal of the historical pieces stands in opposition to the playful,
almost childlike nature of the building blocks. This contrast seems to neutralize
the warlike essence of the Imanol’s pieces when viewed alongside MODO’s
collection, which appear almost as if they were taken from an archaeological
museum of Asian history.

At one point, Imanol mentioned that his creations represent a fusion of
Japanese culture and Mexican craftsmanship. By incorporating traditional
patterns into his LEGO swords, he generates geometric, multicolored designs
reminiscent of artisanal techniques.


# Imanol

Imanol’s fascination with Japanese culture is evident in this message, entirely
encoded for a Western audience and directed at visitors from within the
facility where he now resides.

In his own words, this is a “conceptual” or interactive piece in which he invites
viewers to decode the handwritten—or rather, drawn—message on large
sheets of paper, using Google Translate.

This project is not only a unique departure from the usual initiatives within
Cevarepsi, but also a natural extension of the Japanese lessons Imanol
teaches his fellow residents.


# Wendoline

In the case of Wendoline, the game of brain transplant was understood
perfectly, and the results were conclusive.

The diversity of techniques she employs in her artwork is remarkable. Unlike
her peers, Wendoline mixes oils, acrylics, colored pencils, and even glitter.
Such skills are not surprising, as she also takes on the role of makeup artist
for all her dormitory companions when necessary.

Her ability to observe and manipulate colors and nuances is evident in the
paintings she makes, where intensity is propelled by the free play intrinsic to
all expressive activities. The characters she paints and draws occasionally
resemble masks that conceal beings wanting to hide from our gaze, yet they
convey messages through the texts and titles of her works.

When Wendoline was asked with whom she would like to engage in a
mind exchange, she answered that she would choose Albert Einstein. Her
reasoning was logical and sensible: “So that he would be a woman.”


# Play is for everyone

Play is a universal activity, regardless of age, place, or time. It brings joy,
connects us, and helps us see the world in new ways.

In this space, we invite you to play, explore, and discover why play is such an
essential part of life. As children, play is how we learn about our surroundings
and develop emotionally, cognitively, and physically. It helps us make friends
and teaches us about rules. And even as we grow up, play remains key to
thinking, creating, relaxing, and even staying active.

During long periods of isolation, play, recreation, and leisure become powerful
motivators, giving life meaning, creating routines, setting goals, and providing
relief in difficult times.

It’s important to recognize leisure and recreation as basic human rights that
contribute to personal, social, and community development. They also play
a role in reducing social and educational gaps in society.
